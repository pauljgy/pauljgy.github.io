Upshot: Eliminating stupid risks has easily been the #1 differentiator in getting better.

For a long time, I thought that between me and higher elo players, there were massive skill differences like insane mechanical gaps, junglers ten steps ahead in macro chess, or crazy teamfighting abilities. But as I'm climbing, I feel that players are just better at not making stupid choices. Reddit has always said "The number one skill to climb is consistency", but what exactly is becoming more consistent? Some observations:

1. Players actually get value out of their abilities by only using them when necessary. 

2. Players are more willing to play from behind (not to say that babyragers and ff15+inters don't exist).

3. General increased skill floor. Before, enemies would often walk alone to establish vision and get caught, or they would overextend while sidelaning, and this would often occur shortly before objectives which gave my team full control. Now, players are not making plays with such obvious downsides.

IMO right now, winning moreso comes from minimizing losing plays/risks. But this also means that more creativity is required to since most teams have ironed out most of their stupid mistakes. Will say though, playing against better players has made this game way more fun!
