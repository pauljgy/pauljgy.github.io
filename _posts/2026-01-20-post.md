In general I think my mid-late game macro has improved, but I am losing games now because of laning. To improve this:

- I am dropping TF because I think playing him lets me skip over trading fundamentals, and bad laning ==> weak mid-game ==> failure to get value out of his macro complexity in mid-late.

- I still enjoy the playstyle of shoving -> roaming -> teamfight, so I will probably pick up Galio to replace him. Same mobility with R, but more forgiving laning tools.

- I will also pick up Syndra, who seems to have everything you would want in a mid-laner; can play in many different comps, and has some great assassin/pick capabilities in later stages of the game. 
	- Syndra has a hard time against enemies that can easily gap close. So we pick Syndra when we are confident that we can space, otherwise Galio.
