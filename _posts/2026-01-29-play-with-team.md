Sometimes it has been more useful to babysit/stick with the team, even if the technically correct play would be to apply pressure elsewhere on the map. Supposedly the splitting macro doesn't matter too much until Diamond+, which is when teams are good enough to get value out of your pressure elsewhere. 

There have been a few situations where my team gets a good pick at a good time before an objective, and instead of moving back towards the objective (which is almost certainly in our hands at this point), people just can't help but dive back into the enemy to fight, and this often results in a throw. Many times I have left my team to return to the objective because it's what I think is the right play, but this decision might be hurting the team. I suppose if my teammates have already made up their mind about fighting/diving in, I might as well help them and see what value we can get out of it.

Some advice I got:
- Sometimes you must play a comp differently from how you would play it on paper. You might need to identify which players on your team have a brain, and work with them together to carry.
