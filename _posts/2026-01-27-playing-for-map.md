Playing a simpler champion like Garen really helps you focus on the rest of the game. A simple kit + high wave-clear makes getting prio easier, and prio lets you impact the rest of the map in the following ways (which seem obvious but IMO have been hard to execute in-game):

- Can rotate first to objective/teamfight
- proxy to get a better back timer
- steal jungle camps
- mess with enemy jungler

Was watching a Chippys stream where he was dominating the enemy Jax, and after he was already up 3/0 on him, he decided that starting to play the map was more valuable than freezing to denying Jax CS. Upshot: Laning is only important up to a point, and playing to impact the map is better for the team.
