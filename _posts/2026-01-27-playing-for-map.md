Playing a simpler champion like Garen really helps you focus on the rest of the game. Playing someone with a simple kit + high wave-clear makes getting prio easier, and we can use prio in the following ways to impact the rest of the map (which seem obvious but IMO have been hard to execute in-game):

- Can rotate first to objective/teamfight
- proxy to get a better back timer
- steal jungle camps
- mess with enemy jungler

Was watching a Chippys stream where he was dominating the enemy Jax, and after he was already up 3/0 on him, he decided that starting to play the map was more valuable than freezing to denying Jax CS. Upshot: Laning is only important up to a point, and playing to impact the map is better for the team.
