The more I play the more I realize I actually lack a lot of fundamental skill and always try to get carried by someone else instead of carrying myself. Some problems:

- I am dropping TF because I am just relying on his ult to snowball bot/gold card to peel in teamfights. My laning on him is quite bad, and bad laning ==> weak mid-game and sidelaning ==> can't really pressure sides of the map ==> can't create numbers advantages in teamfights.

- A more failsafe version of this is probably Galio. Similar mobility with R and peel in the rest of his kit, but more forgiving laning/teamfight tools.

- Kind of want to pick up Syndra, who seems to really good versatility; can play like a normal control mage in front-to-back fights, and has some great assassin/pick capabilities in later stages of the game.
